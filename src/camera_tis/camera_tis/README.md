To successfully utilize the camera hardware, host and container should be configurated with cautions:
- Make sure the camera is connected with USB 3.0 by using `lsusb` etc. (host)
- Check the UDev rule is installed correctly under `/et/udev/rules.d`. (host)
- Check `tcam-uvc-extension-loader` is installed under `/usr/bin`. (host)
- Check `libtcam-uvc-extension.so` is installed under `/usr/lib`. (host)
- Check `uvc-extension` is installed under `/usr/share/theimagingsource/tiscamera`. (host)
- Make sure the `/dev/video*` is mapped into container via --device option. (host, container)
- Make sure the user is in group: video if you plan to use it as non root. (container)
- Make sure the debian install file runs successfully.
